The website aims to implement the political leadership's directions in supporting and empowering youth through partnerships with all government bodies 
to prepare a generation of student leaders from Egyptian universities to become leaders of Egypt in 2030. 
The program includes organizing camps and discussion sessions, creating a crisis management team, organizing training courses, executing youth seminars,
and establishing committees to utilize the capabilities of university students and achieve a comprehensive national dialogue.
The website aims to raise awareness and empower young people to understand the concept of voluntary work, enhance their personal skills,
and prepare them for the job market with high levels of awareness and efficiency. The committees' proposed areas of focus include environmental affairs,
education, governance, and anti-corruption. The website provides statistics on the number of volunteers, seminars, and workshops held,
and the universities included in the program.
